# Optimal-Portfolio-Construction-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulation


This project demonstrates the process of constructing an optimized investment portfolio using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The focus is on selecting a diversified set of 10 stocks, calculating the maximum Sharpe ratio, and determining the optimal asset allocation. The project involves several key steps, including:

Data Collection: Using yfinance to gather daily adjusted closing prices for the selected stocks.
Correlation Analysis: Generating a correlation heatmap to assess the relationships between the selected stocks, ensuring effective diversification.
Portfolio Simulation: Implementing a Monte Carlo simulation to explore various asset weight combinations, aiming to maximize the portfolio's Sharpe ratio.
Efficient Frontier Visualization: Plotting the efficient frontier to visualize the trade-off between portfolio risk (volatility) and return, identifying the optimal portfolio.
Risk-Return Analysis: Analyzing the risk and return characteristics of the optimal portfolio, leveraging the insights gained from the Sharpe ratio and efficient frontier.
This project provides a practical application of portfolio optimization techniques, leveraging Python for financial analysis and data visualization. The results offer valuable insights into constructing a well-diversified portfolio that balances risk and return, making it a useful resource for both novice and experienced investors.
